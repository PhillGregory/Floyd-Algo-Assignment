# Floyd-Algo-Assignment

## This project is a fully functional Floyd algorithm written recursively using Python

The aim of this project is to take an iterative version of Floyd's algorithm, and rewrite it recursively.
Floyd's algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between all vertices in a matrix. I used Visual Studio Code to create this project.

This project includes:

* An imperative solution to Floyd's algorithm
* An iterative solution to Floyd's algorithm
* A recursive solution to Floyd's algorithm
* Unit tests to prove the algorithm's functionality
* Performance tests to compare the efficiency of each version of the algorithm

## Installation and usage instructions
1. Clone this project using my repository link https://github.com/PhillipGregory/Floyd-Algo-Assignment.git
2. Check and install any requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the code for the desired algorithm in the FLoyd_Algorithms code
4. Run the code directly on your chosen IDE

## Known issues
Unit tests are still showing errors. I am working to fix this so all algorithms pass their respective unit test.
The goal of each unit test is to prove that an input matrix is equal to a known expected result after the algorithm has been run on the input
